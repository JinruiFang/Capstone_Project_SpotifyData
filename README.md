# README: Spotify Data Analysis Capstone Project

## Project Overview
- **Title**: Exploring Music Trends using Spotify Data
- **Institution**: NYU MSDS
- **Author**: [Jinrui Fang]

## Objective
This project aims to analyze Spotify data to understand the dynamics of song popularity and genre features, culminating in the creation of personalized mixtapes for users.

## Methodology
- Utilized statistical and machine learning techniques, including regression, clustering, and classification models.
- Employed collaborative filtering using cosine similarity for personalized music recommendations.
- Predicted user ratings for unrated songs to curate top 10 song recommendations per user.

## Key Findings
- Developed a predictive model for song popularity based on audio features.
- Achieved a 60% hit rate in comparing personalized recommendations with popular 'greatest hits'.
- Demonstrated the system's ability to balance individual preferences with overall trends.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Machine Learning Libraries (e.g., scikit-learn)
- Data Analysis Tools (e.g., Pandas, NumPy)

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required Python packages.
3. Run the analysis scripts to reproduce the findings or to apply the model to new data.
